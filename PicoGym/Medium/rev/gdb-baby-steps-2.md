## Write up

This was also kinda easy but helped me learn some GDB. The challenges asked me
```
Can you figure out what is in the eax register at the end of the main function? Put your answer in the picoCTF flag format: picoCTF{n} where n is the contents of the eax register in the decimal number base. If the answer was 0x11 your flag would be picoCTF{17}.
```
Like the last challenge, I disassembled main first. This revealed multiple calculations on eax. 
```
pwndbg> disassemble main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000401106 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000040110a <+4>:     push   rbp
   0x000000000040110b <+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x000000000040110e <+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x14],edi
   0x0000000000401111 <+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x20],rsi
   0x0000000000401115 <+15>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],0x1e0da
   0x000000000040111c <+22>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc],0x25f
   0x0000000000401123 <+29>:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x0
   0x000000000040112a <+36>:    jmp    0x401136 <main+48>
   0x000000000040112c <+38>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x000000000040112f <+41>:    add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],eax
   0x0000000000401132 <+44>:    add    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8],0x1
   0x0000000000401136 <+48>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x0000000000401139 <+51>:    cmp    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0xc]
   0x000000000040113c <+54>:    jl     0x40112c <main+38>
   0x000000000040113e <+56>:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4]
   0x0000000000401141 <+59>:    pop    rbp
   0x0000000000401142 <+60>:    ret
```

So I set a break point on the last eax instruct using 
```
break *0x000000000040113e
```
This revealed the eax was now
```
 â–º 0x40113e       <main+56>                       mov    eax, dword ptr [rbp - 4]     EAX, [0x7fffffffdc1c] => 0x4af4b
 ```
 0x4af4b. So I used p on it again and got the result!


I learned
- GDB break points show the eax value at the end of the line of instruction as above
- Can set a breakpoint at a specific address using ```break *(address)```
